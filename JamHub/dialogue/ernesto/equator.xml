      <Page>Cool, you made it.</Page>
      <Page>So, this is a showcase of some of the popular mods that have been made for Outer Wilds, if you want to read about them.</Page>
      <Page>There's also three other showcases, they're for popular New Horizons mods, upcoming New Horizons mods, and mods that won the previous jams.</Page>
      <Page>They're all on the equator, so I'm not gonna bother showing you them. Instead I'm gonna show you the thingamajig at the south pole, so meet me there.</Page>
