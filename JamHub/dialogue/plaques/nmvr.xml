        Mod: NomaiVR
Authors: Raicuparta and Artum
      </Page>
      <Page>This mod allows Outer Wilds to be played using a VR headset, even remapping inputs to allow the use of VR controllers, permitting players to interact with the world of Outer Wilds with their own hands.</Page>
      <Page>While certainly a technical achievement, the main merit of this mod is how it allows players of the game to experience in a whole new way, fully appreciating the scale and scenery of the game.</Page>
      <Page>(Speaking of scale, you might try checking out an anglerfish with this mod. I bet youâ€™ll find them to be much larger than you thought they were!)</Page>
