        Mod: The Vision
Author: hearth1an
      </Page>
      <Page>The Vision incorporates the story of both the base game of Outer Wilds and the DLC Echoes of the Eye, providing a continuation of both.</Page>
      <Page>While the scale of the mod is not as impressive as some more recent releases, it was very impressive and highly anticipated at the time of release.</Page>
      <Page>Much of this is because The Vision was the first story mod to combine the tools and utilities provided by New Horizons with the adaptability of custom code, creating an experience that was more robust and complete than any that had been provided thus far.</Page>
