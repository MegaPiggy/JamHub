        Mod: Quantum Space Buddies&#13;&#10;Authors: _nebula, JohnCorby, and friends
      </Page>
      <Page>An impressive technical achievement only recently reaching full release, Quantum Space Buddies turns the singleplayer Outer Wilds into a multiplayer experience!</Page>
      <Page>By sending a generated code, this mod allows you to invite other players to join your game, where they can read text, make discoveries, and crash the ship just as well as you can.</Page>
      <Page>A monumental amount of work has gone into this mod, and it satisfies the want to experience the world of Outer Wilds with a copilot at your side (just make sure that they buckle up!)</Page>
