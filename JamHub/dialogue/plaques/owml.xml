      <Page>The backbone of all other mods, OWML is the software responsible for making the code written by modders actually affect the game.</Page>
      <Page>Not only does OWML allow mods to interface with the game on a basic level, it also provides a number of handy helpers to mod developers, giving them easier ways to influence the game.</Page>
      <Page>(Some of those helpers were used in the tricker parts of this mod, so I personally have a lot of thanks for OWMLâ€™s authors!)</Page>
