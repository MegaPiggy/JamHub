        Mod: The Outsider&#13;&#10;Author: Streetlights Behind the Trees
      </Page>
      <Page>The Outsider is a mod that adds many new features and locations to the surface of Dark Bramble, utilizing a space that is virtually untouched by the base game.</Page>
      <Page>When it was released, The Outsider was the largest story mod the community had seen by a wide margin, and was made entirely without the use of New Horizons.</Page>
      <Page>While it is not maintained on an entirely regular basis, this mod is still an excellent experience that has stayed as a fond memory in the minds of those who played it.</Page>
