        Mod: Wrong Warp&#13;&#10;Authors: Hawkbar, Insmoshable, and TeamKabuki
      </Page>
      <Page>Wrong Warp seeks to provide an alternate course for the player to take, exploring the nature of the Eye of the Universe and the complicated nature between it and the creatures of the universe.</Page>
      <Page>This mod will feature a variety of new game mechanics, puzzles, and other surprises that will be revealed at release. It also seems to take place in another star system.</Page>
      <Page>Wrong Warp features some of the same developers as the recently released Arcanum Adrift, a team that has shown promise on multiple occasions. Overall, the Outer Wilds modding community is very excited to see what this mod has to offer!</Page>
