        Mod: Mindscapes
Authors: coderCleric
      </Page>
      <Page>Mindscapes is the mod that won third place in the second mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community.</Page>
      <Page>This mod tasks the player with convincing Slate that the imminent death of the Sun is going to happen using a new Nomai artifact that allows one person to invade the mind of another.</Page>
      <Page>This may turn out not to be a simple task however, as Slate has true mastery over their mind and is able to keep the player secluded to a small area of it. Perhaps thereâ€™s a way to break out?</Page>
      <Page>(Also, yes, I made this mod, but it still got third so I still get to talk about it! Ha!)</Page>
