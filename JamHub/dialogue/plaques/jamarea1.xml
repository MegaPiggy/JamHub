      <Page>This platform showcases the winners of the modding community's first mod jam, held in January of 2023 with the themes "clockwork" and "layers".</Page>
      <Page>This jam had a special restriction, as it did not allow for custom code to be written. Instead, all mods submitted had to implement their mechanics solely with what was allowed by New Horizons.</Page>
      <Page>While there were intended to be three winners for the jam, competition was tight to the point that some mods scored exactly the same number of points.</Page>
      <Page>With no way to assign a clear winner, a total of four mods were declared to take up the top places. Two shared first place, and two more shared second.</Page>
      <Page>Despite the complications, this mod jam was widely enjoyed by participants and audience alike, setting the tone for what was sure to become a beloved tradition of the community.</Page>
      <Page>If you want to, you can meet the creators of these mods at the party on the north pole!</Page>
