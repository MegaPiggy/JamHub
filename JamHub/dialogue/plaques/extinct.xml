        Mod: Extinction
        Author: Bird
      </Page>
      <Page>Extinction is one of the story mods that has spent the longest time in development, and is also one of the most anticipated.</Page>
      <Page>The mod has a dedicated thread in the nh-addon-dev of the modding discord that gives some idea of what is to come, but much of the development is unknown to those not on the team.</Page>
      <Page>While not much is known of the overall story of the mod, what we do know is that it will be related to the origin of Dark Bramble, and that it is sure to be a blast to play.</Page>
