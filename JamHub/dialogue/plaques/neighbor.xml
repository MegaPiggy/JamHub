        Mod: Hearth’s Neighbor
Authors: GameWyrm, EndgameZero, Lumine0409, and FunkyShoeMan
      </Page>
      <Page>Hearth’s Neighbor is the mod that won first place in the second mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community.</Page>
      <Page>This mod sees the player traveling to a new star system with a single, lonely planet orbiting its star. Don’t let the planets’ size fool you though, it has plenty more to see than initially meets the eye!</Page>
      <Page>There is good reason that this mod won first place in the jam, as it uses a combination of New Horizons and custom code to introduce more puzzles, mechanics, and exotic locations not seen in the base game.</Page>
