        Mod: Eyes of the Past
Authors: Pikpik, Etherpod, Maya, Viovayo, John Corby, tashizuna, Repcon, and ditzy
      </Page>
      <Page>Eyes of the Past takes place on the home moon of the inhabitants of the Stranger, long before the events that take place during the DLC.</Page>
      <Page>This mod will task the player with uncovering the mystery of what caused the inhabitants to make the great sacrifice that they did, as well as broader strokes about the past of their people.</Page>
      <Page>From this image alone, it is clear that this mod promises to be visually striking and quite a sight to behold. As a bonus, Pikpik (the lead author of the mod) makes frequent posts on the Outer Wilds modding community Discord with teasers about the mod.</Page>
