        Mod: Tesseract’s Secret
Authors: Can’t Afford a Name
      </Page>
      <Page>Tesseract’s Secret is the mod that won second place in the second mod jam hosted by the Outer Wilds modding community.</Page>
      <Page>This mod is quite interesting, tasking the player with exploring a hidden planet with strange structures dotting its surface. Unfortunately, the structures are sealed (at least until you find a way to open them!)</Page>
      <Page>This mod is quite creative, making very good use of the space it takes up. While there is only one planet added, the contents of that planet are quite dense, making for a very enjoyable experience!</Page>
