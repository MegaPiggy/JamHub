      <Page>Hello there, I'm _nebula! I worked on QSB with JohnCorby, and also did a lot of work on OWML.</Page>
      <Page>Me, Raicuparta, AmazingAlek, and TAImatem were the original modders for the game, and together we made all of the original versions of the modding tools and infrastructure everyone uses today!</Page>
      <Page>There was even a point before Echoes of the Eye released, that I was the only person still modding for this game... I'm glad to see how much the community has grown since!</Page>
