      <Page>Hello there. People call me Streetlights. That’s not my real name.</Page>
      <Page>I made The Outsider mod, I guess. But working on it gave me TRAUMA, which my doctor Jaru says makes me psychopathic and genocidal. But only in some timelines.</Page>
      <Page>Currently, I’m making a game called Protostellar, which contains microtonal music, queer furry characters, and megastructures.</Page>
			<Page>Have a wonderful day. Or, at least, don’t forget to try to sometimes.</Page>
